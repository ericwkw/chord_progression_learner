# 🎸 ChordLab: The Guitar Song Maker!

**Welcome to ChordLab!** This is a fun playground where you can build your own guitar songs, even if you’ve never studied music theory before. 

It’s like building with LEGOs, but for music! 🧱🎵

## 🌟 What Can You Do?

### 1. **Meet "The Team"** 🤝
When you pick a **Key** (like C Major), the app automatically finds a team of chords that work perfectly together. No more guessing—these chords are best friends!

### 2. **See the Map (Fretboard)** 🗺️
Don't know how to play a "G Major"? No problem! The **Fretboard** shows you exactly where to put your fingers on the guitar strings. It even shows you different ways (voicings) to play the same chord.

### 3. **Add Some "Spice"** 🌶️
Bored of normal chords? Open the **Spice Rack**! You can swap a regular chord for a fancy version (like a *Sus4* or *Add9*) to make your song sound sparkly and professional.

### 4. **Happy Accidents (Wildcards)** 🃏
Sometimes, breaking the rules sounds cool. The **Wildcards** section gives you special chords that don't technically "belong" but sound amazing if you use them right.

### 5. **Ask the Robot Tutor** 🤖
We have a super-smart AI brain (Google Gemini) living inside the app. Build your song, click **"Analyze"**, and the AI will explain *why* your song sounds happy, sad, or exciting!

## 🏗️ For the Builders (The Tech Stuff)

If you are a coder looking at the engine, here are the parts we used to build this machine:

*   **React**: The tool for building the screen and buttons.
*   **Web Audio API**: The magic that makes guitar sounds directly in the browser (no MP3 files!).
*   **Google Gemini API**: The Artificial Intelligence that acts as the music teacher.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: The paint and style that makes it look cool.
